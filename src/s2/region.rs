/// RegionCoverer allows arbitrary regions to be approximated as unions of cells (CellUnion).

///
///	rc := &s2.RegionCoverer{MaxLevel: 30, MaxCells: 5}
///	r := s2.Region(CapFromCenterArea(center, area))
///	covering := rc.Covering(r)
///
/// This yields a CellUnion of at most 5 cells that is guaranteed to cover the
/// given region (a disc-shaped region on the sphere).
///
/// For covering, only cells where (level - MinLevel) is a multiple of LevelMod will be used.
/// This effectively allows the branching factor of the S2 CellID hierarchy to be increased.
/// Currently the only parameter values allowed are 0/1, 2, or 3, corresponding to
/// branching factors of 4, 16, and 64 respectively.
///
/// Note the following:
///
///  - MinLevel takes priority over MaxCells, i.e. cells below the given level will
///    never be used even if this causes a large number of cells to be returned.
///
///  - For any setting of MaxCells, up to 6 cells may be returned if that
///    is the minimum number of cells required (e.g. if the region intersects
///    all six face cells).  Up to 3 cells may be returned even for very tiny
///    convex regions if they happen to be located at the intersection of
///    three cube faces.
///
///  - For any setting of MaxCells, an arbitrary number of cells may be
///    returned if MinLevel is too high for the region being approximated.
///
///  - If MaxCells is less than 4, the area of the covering may be
///    arbitrarily large compared to the area of the original region even if
///    the region is convex (e.g. a Cap or Rect).
///
/// The approximation algorithm is not optimal but does a pretty good job in
/// practice. The output does not always use the maximum number of cells
/// allowed, both because this would not always yield a better approximation,
/// and because MaxCells is a limit on how much work is done exploring the
/// possible covering as well as a limit on the final output size.
///
/// Because it is an approximation algorithm, one should not rely on the
/// stability of the output. In particular, the output of the covering algorithm
/// may change across different versions of the library.
///
/// One can also generate interior coverings, which are sets of cells which
/// are entirely contained within a region. Interior coverings can be
/// empty, even for non-empty regions, if there are no cells that satisfy
/// the provided constraints and are contained by the region. Note that for
/// performance reasons, it is wise to specify a MaxLevel when computing
/// interior coverings - otherwise for regions with small or zero area, the
/// algorithm may spend a lot of time subdividing cells all the way to leaf
/// level to try to find contained cells.
